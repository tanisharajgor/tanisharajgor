Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tanisha, a Data Science & Business Administration major at Northeastern University. Previously, I have developed solutions for Accenture and AI4ALL, as well as conducted deep-learning focused research projects presented at MIT, Junior Humanities Science Symposium, and the National Henry Ford Invention Convention. 

I aspire to leverage analytical/statistical skills in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to make systems more efficient, accessible, and innovative.

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Data Science Intern at FM Global and a Junior Developer for the Center of Design.

Fun Things!
